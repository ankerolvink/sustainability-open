How to use the sustainability-open framework
--------------------------------------------

This document describes how you can use the sustainability-open framework. 
Please note that the framework itself does not do much. You will need to download separate plug-ins that provide components which design, analyse, assess and optimise your building or object. 
The framework provides the base infrastructure. 

To use the framework, download the latest zip package and unzip this in a directory. Point Grasshopper to this directory and when you start Grasshopper, it should automatically start.
